# Eval_Search-and-Optimization-Algorithms
This project implements key search and optimization algorithms in Python for a university Intelligent Systems assignment. It features BFS, IDS, A*, Simulated Annealing, Dynamic Programming, and Linear Programming on a 2D grid with obstacles, plus a runner that tests, compares, and reports results.
